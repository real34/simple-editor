simple-editor
=============

Temporary repository for playing with React / File API and stuff like this

A Demo is available at: http://real34.github.io/simple-editor/

## Installation

```
$ npm install
```

## Building and browsing

Example with professional tools (troll inside ;))

```
$ npm run build
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
$ xdg-open http://localhost:8000
```

## Experimenting with the code

Reading code is cool, but feel free to play with it, experiment and break things. Just run:

```
$ npm run dev
```

It will launch the server and watch JS files for rebuilding them upon change.
